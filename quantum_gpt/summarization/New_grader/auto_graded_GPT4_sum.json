The first order correction to the energy in perturbation theory can be calculated as the expectation value of the perturbation Hamiltonian in the unperturbed state. However, because the perturbation only changes $k$, the wave-function (and thus the first order correction which is $\\langle H' \\rangle$) remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the second order correction term becomes crucial. The second order correction to the ground state energy, $E_0^2$, can be calculated using the following equation for a non-degenerate ground state:\n\n$$E_0^{(2)} = \\sum_{n\\neq0} \\frac{ |\\langle n|H'|0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0^{(0)} - E_n^{(0)}}$$\n\nwhere $H'$ represents the perturbation in the Hamiltonian, and $E_n^{(0)}$ and $E_0^{(0)}$ are the unperturbed energies of the states. \n\nIt is assumed that the perturbation is small, leading to $\\epsilon << 1$ to justify using perturbation theory.\n\nNow, because $H' = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon kx^2$ and we know the ground state of a harmonic oscillator, and the matrix elements of $x^2$ for harmonic oscillator states, we can use that information to calculate $E_0^{(2)}$.\n\nHowever, an important simplification occurs in the harmonic oscillator system: the difference in energy between any two states is constant and equal to $\\hbar\\omega$ (this is due to the equal spacing in the quantum energy levels of a harmonic oscillator). Therefore, the denominator in the sum simplifies to this constant value and the sum component then only depends on the numerator: the matrix elements of the perturbation Hamiltonian.\n\nDepending on how detailed you want the calculation to be, the calculation of $|\\langle n|H'|0 \\rangle|^2$ for harmonic oscillators involves utilizing the ladder operator method, or alternatively, integral calculations with the Hermite polynomial representations of the wavefunctions.

        <h3>Good Practices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Be Specific: Clearly mention which part of the response you found accurate or inaccurate.</li>
            <li>Provide Context: If possible, give a brief explanation of why you agree or disagree with the response.</li>
            <li>Constructive Criticism: If you find an error or discrepancy in the response, suggest how it can be improved or corrected.</li>
            <li>Stay Relevant: Ensure your comments pertain to the quantum-related question and response.</li>
            <li>Politeness Counts: Remember, Quantum GPT is a tool in development. Approach feedback with a constructive and respectful tone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Avoid:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Vague Feedback: Comments like "This is wrong" without any further explanation aren't helpful.</li>
            <li>Personal Opinions: Avoid basing feedback solely on personal beliefs or unverified opinions.</li>
            <li>Inappropriate Language: Refrain from using offensive or inappropriate language in your comments.</li>
            <li>Multiple Comments: If you have additional feedback on a single response, try to consolidate it into one comment.</li>
            <li>Spamming: Please don't spam the comment section with irrelevant content or promotional material.</li>
